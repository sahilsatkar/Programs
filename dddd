✅ The SIMPLEST Safe Workflow (Solo Dev)

You only need 3 branches:

main       → stable / production
dev        → tested locally
feature/*  → work in progress


That’s it. Nothing more.

🧱 What Each Branch Means
🔵 main

Always working

What runs on server

Never commit directly here

🟡 dev

Your daily work branch

You test everything locally here

This is your “safe playground”

🟢 feature/*

One feature or fix at a time

Can break freely

Short-lived

🛠️ One-Time Setup (10 minutes)
1️⃣ Create dev branch
git checkout -b dev
git push -u origin dev

2️⃣ Protect main (Very Important)

On GitHub:

Settings → Branches

Protect main

Require pull request

Disable direct push

This saves you from yourself 😄

🔄 Your New Daily Workflow
🔹 Step 1: Start Work
git checkout dev
git pull
git checkout -b feature/db-migration

🔹 Step 2: Code Locally

Make changes

Run locally

Fix errors locally

npm run dev

🔹 Step 3: Commit Small
git add .
git commit -m "Add initial Postgres setup"


Push feature:

git push -u origin feature/db-migration

🔹 Step 4: Merge Feature → Dev

On GitHub:

Open PR: feature/db-migration → dev

Review yourself

Merge

Now dev = working + tested

🔹 Step 5: Deploy Only From Main

When dev is stable:

git checkout main
git pull
git merge dev
git push


👉 Server auto-deploys only from main.

🔁 Rollback Becomes EASY
🔙 Roll back server
git checkout main
git reset --hard <LAST_GOOD_COMMIT>
git push --force


Or even easier:

git revert <bad_commit>

🧪 Testing Without Pain
Local

Always test on feature/* or dev

Never test on server

Server

Server only runs main

No surprises

🔐 Extra Safety (Highly Recommended)
Tag stable releases
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0


Now rollback is 1 command.

🚫 What to STOP Doing (Important)

❌ Coding directly on main

❌ Debugging on server

❌ Pushing without testing

❌ Mixing multiple changes in one commit

🧠 Why This Works

You always know what’s deployed

You always have a restore point

You reduce stress

You move faster

This is how professional solo devs work.

✅ Final Simple Rule

Local → feature → dev → main → server

If you follow just this, 90% of your current pain disappears.
